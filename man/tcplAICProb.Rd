\title{Calculate the AIC probabilities}
\usage{
tcplAICProb(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{Numeric vectors of AIC values}
}
\value{
A vector of probability values for each model given, as a list.
}
\description{
\code{tcplAICProb} Calculates the probability that the model best represents 
the data based on the AIC value for each model.
}
\details{
The function takes vectors of AIC values. Each vector represents the model
AIC values for multiple observation sets. Each vector must contain the same 
number and order of observation sets. The calculation assumes every possible
model is accounted for, and the results should be interpreted accordingly.
}
\examples{
## Returns the probability for each model, given models with AIC values 
## ranging from 80 to 100
tcplAICProb(80, 85, 90, 95, 100)

## Also works for vectors
m1 <- c(95, 195, 300) ## model 1 for three different observations
m2 <- c(100, 200, 295) ## model 2 for three different observations
tcplAICProb(m1, m2)
