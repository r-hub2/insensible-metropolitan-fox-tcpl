\title{Write level 0 screening data into the tcpl databases}
\usage{
tcplWriteLvl0(dat, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{data.table, the screening data to load}

\item{type}{Character of length 1, the data type, "sc" or "mc"}
}
\description{
\code{tcplWriteLvl0} takes a data.table with level 0 screening data and 
writes the data into the level 0 tables in the tcpl databases.
}
\details{
This function appends data onto the existing table. It also deletes all the 
data for any acids or aeids dat contains from the given and all downstream 
tables.

Before writing any data the function maps the assay component source name(s)
(acsn) to assay component id (acid), ensures the proper class on each field
and checks for every test compound sample id (spid where wllt == "t") in the
tcpl chemical database. If field types get changed a warning is given 
listing the affected fields and they type they were coerced to. If the 
acsn(s) or spid(s) do not map to the tcpl databases the function will return
an error and the data will not be written.

The data type can be either 'mc' for mutliple concentration data, or 'sc'
for single concentration data. Multiple concentration data will be loaded
into the level tables, whereas the single concentration will be loaded into
the single tables.
}
\note{
This function should only be used to load level 0 data.
